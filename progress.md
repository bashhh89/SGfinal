# Social Garden AI Efficiency Scorecard Tool - Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Backend Logic
- [x] Project Creation and Initial Setup (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, PNPM, Port 3003, Branding colors, progress-tracker.md created)
- [x] Env Setup (.env.local with OPENAI_API_KEY)
- [x] Implemented API Route using Pollinations.AI (basic POST, phased Q&A logic, report generation)
- [x] Backend error handling, logging, and JSON parsing fixes

## Phase 2: Dynamic Data Implementation with Curated Tools & Filtering Logic
- [x] Industry Input UI and state management
- [x] Dynamic Q&A UI: phased progress, answer input types, AI "thinking" animation
- [x] Results Display: score/tier, markdown, branding, 3-column layout
- [x] Recommended Tools page now auto-filters by the simulated user profile's keyChallengesOrOpportunities on initial load (selectedChallenges is initialized accordingly)

## Learning Hub & User Experience
- [x] Sidebar navigation, progress bar, tip of the day
- [x] Tiered checklists, prompt library with interactive placeholders and copy
- [x] Fully implemented Recommended Tools tab with challenge/category filters, tooltips, and mobile-friendly design
- [x] Refactored sidebar and main content logic for single-source-of-truth state
- [x] Fixed hydration/SSR bugs in Next.js
- [x] General codebase cleanup and improved project structure
- [x] Committed and pushed all recent changes to GitHub (https://github.com/bashhh89/SGfina)

## Refinements & Fixes
- [x] Typing animation for AI "thinking"
- [x] Bug fixes: animation, isLoading, answer input, layout
- [x] Final user-confirmed 3-column layout for Q&A

## Debugging & Refinements
- [x] Investigated persistent hydration mismatch on `/learning-hub` and "Recommended Tools" page.
- [x] Verified all state initialization, conditional rendering, and HTML structure for SSR/CSR safety.
- [x] Determined that the `cz-shortcut-listen` attribute is not set by project code and is likely injected by a browser extension.
- [x] Recommended testing in a clean browser environment and on a production deployment to confirm.

## Scorecard Report Enhancements
- [x] Styled web display of the AI-generated scorecard report for optimal visual appeal and readability.
- [x] Overhauled Scorecard Report web display for a structured, app-like UX (inspired by image_a240cd.jpg).
- [x] Revised system prompt for LLM to generate more detailed and comprehensive report content.
